                <p>For 10 days, 2 of my sisters + a friend of my sister, frolicked across the Anatolian Peninsula.
                The people were friendly even when we had no common language to communicate in. The food was
                otherworldly, and my sister regularly brings up Turkish dessert in our conversations. The landscape
                was indescribable, but I'll try! We divided our time between Istanbul and Antalya, so we got to see 
                the urban core of the country and the beautiful seaside with the Taurus Mountains in the distance. 
                Lest we forget, <em>the cats</em>! I got into the habit of ordering a bit more food at outdoor 
                restaurants, just so the little fluff balls slinking between my ankles got to have a snack too! 
                Words don't do Türkiye justice.

                <p>Though I was born in the States, I feel a strong connection with my homeland, Senegal. My parents
                    make frequent trips when they can, and it's always a pleasure to return when I am not in school.
                    When I think of Senegal, I think of trips to the fabric district and the tailor, fresh bread 
                    every morning, the impossibly loud tabar drum in your ear at a wedding, the art of taxi
                    driver haggling, and the reacclimation period of walking on sand with flip flops, and the 
                    cheek-to-cheek kiss greeting. <em>Home</em>.

                <p>In December 2022, I was about $200 short of keeping my Medallion status, and even after begging
                several Delta customer serice representatives, I was told I would have to actually travel before
                the New Year or else I would lose my progress! I know I said I love to travel, but an impromptu
                trip when I would've preferred to buy a gift card was not what I had planned! In typical Capricorn fashion, I planned the shortest possible trip I could without spending more than 
                a dollar than I absoluteley had to. 12 hrs in New York City, no hotel. Just me, my giant tote bag and 
                winter clothes that were ill suited for the city. I went to the MOMA, saw the Rockefeller tree, and sat at the 
                steps of the Met Gossip Girl style. Then, I shopped off of my birthday list, until I realized I would have
                to hold the bags all day. New York in 12 hours, quick and efficient.
